A unigram crossword solver using Matt Ginsberg's comprehensive database of 
clues and answers. For more information than you ever wanted to know,
read our paper. Here's the abstract:

We implement a single-module computational crossword solver applying natural 
language processing methodologies. The solver, called CRIS, first parses 
crossword puzzle clues using a unigram model to compute probabilities for 
possible answers to each clue from similar clues in a clue database. 
CRIS then executes one of three iterative algorithms to fill in the crossword 
puzzle grid with its best guesses: word-by-word, letter-by-letter, or 
combination fill methods. When tested on a selection of New York Times 
crossword puzzles from different days of the week, our results showed that 
CRIS could solve many puzzles well and a few puzzles perfectly using one of 
its three fill methods.

Happy crosswording!
